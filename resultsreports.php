<h2>Results Reports 101</h2>
    <legend>What are JDAI Results Reports?</legend>
    <p>JDAI sites began submitting annual results reports to AECF in 2004.  These reports have two primary purposes: (1) to provide sites with an annual opportunity to assemble and report measures of detention reform progress that can be shared with local system stakeholders, policy makers and the community; and, (2) to generate initiative-wide aggregate measures and inter-site comparisons to deepen our understanding of the overall impact, influence and leverage of the detention reform movement. </p>

<p>Results Reports are prepared by JDAI site personnel, using local data sources, with assistance and expert guidance from their assigned Technical Assistance Team Leaders (TATLs), and submitted to JDAI every Fall (typically in September or October).  The information in the Results Reports is carefully reviewed and analyzed by AECF and the JDAI management team, and summarized in a document published annually by AECF.  Because it is not feasible for the JDAI management team to independently validate the information submitted by every site, it is the responsibility of each JDAI site, in partnership with their TATL, to provide the most accurate, complete information they can.  JDAI sites have always made diligent efforts to fulfill that responsibility, and as a result of those efforts there has been steady improvement year-to-year in the completeness, consistency and accuracy of the Results Reports. The resulting data set provides valuable insights into the progress of detention reform across JDAI jurisdictions, for the benefit of the sites themselves, the JDAI management team, and the juvenile justice field as a whole.</p>

<legend>What are the JDAI Results Reports Indicators?</legend>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" width="739">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3>Impact Indicators</h3></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Baseline Period Start/Finish and Recent Period   Start/Finish</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>Impact results are determined by measuring the change in these   indicators between a baseline year and a recent year. The baseline year   refers to a 12-month period prior to the site&rsquo;s implementation of JDAI; and   the recent year refers to a 12-month period ending shortly before JDAI Results   Reports are collected in the Fall of each year.Â  Sites vary in the specific time periods   they use for their &ldquo;recent year&rdquo; reporting period, but as of 2014 all sites   are expected to use a 12-month period ending between December 2013 and August   2014. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Total Detention Capacity</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>How many secure   juvenile detention beds are available for use by the site in the reporting   year? </p>
      <p>Most JDAI sites   track staffed, budgeted secure detention capacity (rather than physical   capacity, which is typically a higher number that is less prone to change   over time), and count only their jurisdictions&rsquo; capacity (rather than   capacity in other jurisdictions that they could potentially access if their   use of detention exceeded their own capacity). </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3>Detention Utilization</h3>
    <p>Detention   Utilization indicators measure how heavily sites use their secure juvenile   detention resources: how many admissions occur each year, how long those   admitted youth stay on average, and how many youth are in secure juvenile   detention on an average day. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most sites include in their Detention   Utilization indicators <u>all</u> youth who spend time in secure detention,   including both pre-adjudicated youth (those securely detained pending the   resolution of delinquent or criminal charges) and post-adjudicated youth   (those held in a secure juvenile detention facility after being adjudicated   or found responsible for a delinquent act). </li>
        <li>Sites that do not include all   securely detained youth in their measurement of these indicators should   ensure that the population covered is consistent across the three indicators   - that is, all categories of youth included in the count of Annual Admissions   should also be included in the ADP and ALOS indicators, and any categories   not included in the Annual Admissions indicator should also be excluded from   the ADP and ALOS indicators. </li>
        <li>When measured accurately and   consistently over time, these three indicators should correspond with each   other in a predictable way, with ADP being roughly equal to the number of   admissions per day (i.e. Annual Admissions divided by the number of days in   the year) multiplied by the average length of stay (measured in days).</li>
      </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Average Daily Population (ADP)</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>During the baseline   and recent periods, what was the average number of youth per day held in   secure detention facilities in your jurisdiction? </p>
      <p>The ADP should   include all days spent in detention during the reporting period by all of the   youth who are included in the Annual Admissions indicator, plus the days   spent in detention during the year by youth who were admitted prior to that   period, i.e. those who were already in detention at the start of the   reporting year. The ADP can be calculated by summing all of the days spent in   secure detention by all youth during the period, and dividing by the number   of days in the period.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Annual Admissions</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>During the baseline   and recent periods, how many times per year was a youth admitted to a secure   juvenile detention facility? </p>
      <p>There can be   multiple admissions during a year for the same youth (e.g. if a youth is   admitted on January 5th and released on January 7th, then brought back to detention   and admitted on January 10th, that would constitute two admissions). </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Average Length of Stay (ALOS)</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>For youth who were   released from secure detention during the baseline and recent periods, what   was the average number of days that they spent in detention from the date of   their admission to the date of their release? </p>
      <p>The ALOS can be   calculated by summing the number of days spent in detention (from admission   date to release date) for all youth released during the year, and dividing   that total by the number of youth released. Note that this calculation   includes any days that these released youth spent in detention <u>prior</u> to the reporting period (i.e. if a youth was admitted five days before the   reporting period and released on the fifth day of the reporting period, all   ten of those days would count toward calculation of the ALOS).</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3>Commitments to State Custody</h3>
    <p>The Detention   Utilization indicators focus on the direct impact of detention reforms. But   JDAI was founded on the idea that the indirect impacts of detention reform   could also produce changes that reduce incarceration at other levels of the   system.Â  The Results Reports therefore   request information about the number of youth who are ultimately found to be   delinquent and committed to the custody of state juvenile corrections   agencies.Â  It has been well-established   in research that youth who are detained prior to a finding of delinquency are   more likely to experience these commitments, so this is an area in which a   reduction in unnecessary detention would reasonably be expected to have an   impact.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>State Commitments</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>During the baseline   and recent periods, how many times was a youth, as part of their disposition,   committed to state custody? </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3>Public Safety</h3>
    <p>JDAI sites seek to <em>safely</em> reduce their use of secure detention, which means maintaining or improving   public safety and compliance with the legal process, at the same time that   they are reducing utilization of detention. To gauge these aspects of   detention reform, sites report on indicators of overall juvenile crime; and   on the rate at which the youth they serve are able to stay out of trouble   (i.e. avoid re-arrest) and comply with the legal process (i.e. appear at all   scheduled court hearings) during the time that they have charges pending   before the juvenile court. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Failure to Appear (FTA) Rate</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>During a baseline   and recent periods, what percentage of youth with juvenile court hearings   scheduled fail to appear at those hearings?Â  </p>
      <p>Sites can choose to   calculate this indicator on the basis of: (a) all youth with juvenile court   hearings; (b) just those youth who are not detained, i.e. who are released   outright or released with some additional services through an Alternative to   Detention (ATD) program; or (c) just those youth who are referred to ATD   programs. Many JDAI sites only started to measure the FTA rate after they   started implementing JDAI, in which case it is not possible for them to   report an FTA rate for the pre-JDAI baseline year that they use for other   indicators. It would be appropriate for those sites to report as their   Baseline FTA Rate the earliest measure of that rate that they can obtain; and   to note in the Comments field on the Final Notes tab what source and time period   that baseline statistic comes from. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Re-Arrest Rate</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636" valign="top"><p>During a baseline   and recent periods, what percentage of youth with charges pending before the   juvenile court were re-arrested on a new charge?Â  </p>
      <p>Sites can choose to   calculate this indicator on the basis of: (a) all youth who were not   detained, i.e. who were released outright or released with some additional   services through an Alternative to Detention (ATD) program; or (b) just those   youth who are referred to ATD programs. Many JDAI sites only started to   measure the pre-adjudication re-arrest rate after they started implementing   JDAI, in which case it is not possible for them to report a re-arrest rate   for the pre-JDAI baseline year that they use for other indicators. It would   be appropriate for those sites to report as their Baseline Re-Arrest Rate the   earliest measure of that rate that they can obtain; and to note in the   Comments field on the Final Notes tab what source and time period that baseline   statistic comes from. </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="97" valign="top"><p><strong>Juvenile Crime Indicator</strong></p></td>
    <td width="636"><p>During the baseline   and recent periods, what was the extent of juvenile crime? </p>
      <p>Different sites   rely on different metrics for this indicator.Â    Most report on the number of felony petitions filed (i.e. the number   of cases in which a youth is formally charged with a felony offense), which   JDAI has recommended as a barometer of serious juvenile offending. Others use   one of three different types of alternative measures: counts of delinquency   petitions (i.e. cases in which any delinquent offense, whether felony or   misdemeanor, is formally charged), counts of juvenile intake cases (i.e.   referrals to the juvenile court or juvenile probation agency, whether or not   any charges are formally filed based on those referrals), and juvenile   arrests (i.e. arrests of persons who are under the jurisdiction&rsquo;s age of   majority). Sites need to specify which type of juvenile crime indicator they   are using by selecting one of these four options from a drop-down list on the   Impact Results tab. Sites may also provide a description of the specific   indicator they are using in the Comments field on the Final Notes tab.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3>Racial/Ethnic Disparities</h3>
    <p>JDAI sites seek to   reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the use of secure detention and commitment.   To gauge their progress toward that goal, sites disaggregate the Detention   Utilization and State Commitments indicators described above, to show how   many Youth of Color (YOC) they are detaining and committing.Â  For purposes of these indicators,   &quot;youth of color&quot; typically means anyone other than White   Non-Hispanic youth (i.e. youth in any Race category other than White, plus   White youth with Hispanic ethnicity). However, sites vary considerably in the   ways that they collect data on the race and ethnicity of the youth they   serve, and some have had to define this population in somewhat different   ways. Such sites should indicate in the Comments field on the Final Notes tab   whether they are using a different definition for YOC, and if so what definition   they are using.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h3>Influence and Leverage Indicators</h3>
    <p>In contrast to the   Impact Indicators - for which sites report data from both a baseline period   and a recent period - the Influence and Leverage indicators focus only on the   recent period. Sites that report this information for a different period of   time than that used for the Recent period on their Impact Indicators, should   state in the Comments field on the Final Notes tab what time period they   examined for their Influence and Leverage indicators.</p></td>

      <p>Leveraged funds may   include specific grants provided by the State Advisory Group (SAG) for reform   activities; private grants, donations or in-kind resources secured to enhance   or expand detention reform; and any local, state or federal funds that are   allocated, or re-allocated from other uses, to support implementation of   detention reforms.</p></td>

      <p>The focus of these   questions is simply to determine, on a consistent basis across JDAI, which of   these practices have been implemented in which sites; and of those that   haven't yet been implemented, how much progress toward implementation has   been achieved up to this point.

</table><br>

<legend>Who needs to submit a Results Report?</legend>
    <p>Every JDAI site is expected to submit a Results Report each year, although the specific information they should provide may be different for some state grantees than for local jurisdictions.

The following table lists all JDAI sites that are believed to be active as of 2014.  Each siteâs name begins with the two-character postal code for the state in which they are located, followed by the name of the jurisdiction they cover. Most JDAI sites are county jurisdictions, and unless otherwise noted the named jurisdictions are counties. Some sites are city/municipal jurisdictions, joint city/county jurisdictions, multi-county collaboratives, or circuit courts, and descriptive names are provided for those sites. Where sites have submitted Results Reports in the past using different names (e.g. â17th Circuitâ one year, âCass and Johnson Countiesâ in another year) references to those aliases are included to help ensure that sites can find themselves on the list.  All local jurisdictions that are directly implementing JDAI should submit Results Reports that are as complete as possible, including all of the Impact indicators.</p>

<p>In addition to local sites, the table lists JDAI state grantees, which work to support JDAI implementation in multiple local jurisdictions; they are shown in this table with their postal code followed by the name âStatewideâ. Historically these grantees have used the Results Reports in a variety of ways.  Some provide a single Results Report each year, including Impact indicators, that covers the whole stateâs JDAI effort (e.g. Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire); others submit Results Reports focusing only on the Influence and Leverage indicators that they directly affect as the lead agency for JDAI in their state, and they require their local sites to submit Impact indicators; others provide aggregated Impact indicators as well as Influence and Leverage information; and others do not submit their own Results Reports, choosing instead to assist their local JDAI sites in submitting separate reports. All state grantees should submit Results Reports each year, containing at a minimum the Influence and Leverage information that they directly affect; and at their discretion, they may choose to submit aggregated Impact indicators as well.
</p>

<legend>Who should I contact with specific questions or concerns?</legend>
    <p>Also included in table <link to the table thatâs part of âGetting Startedâ> are the assigned TATLs for each site. These individuals should be the first point of contact for any questions or concerns about Annual Results Reports. They will address as many of your questions and concerns as they can, and when necessary they will escalate them to the appropriate members of the JDAI team. Questions pertaining to JDAI or AECF policy will be escalated to the JDAI Management Team (which includes Bart Lubow and Gail D. Mumford of AECF, as well as Stephanie Vetter of the Pretrial Justice Institute and Raquel Mariscal of the W. Haywood Burns Institute). Questions regarding data requirements, or the Results Reporting website itself, will be directed to Tom Woods at AECF.
